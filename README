Building and executing:
1. Make sure the backend is running and functional.
2. cd into /malphas/ and install npm packages inside that folder with `npm install`
3. Inside the same folder run `npm run dev`

After changing the openapi specs the npm `openapi-generate` command has to be run before executing the frontend.
